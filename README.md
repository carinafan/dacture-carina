# Dacture examples 
Example outputs from my work as a machine learning engineer at Dacture.

Dacture’s product was a software platform that allowed people to easily run and interpret machine learning models without any code or ML experience. 
My role was to code end-to-end flows in Python and R to automatically run and interpret the appropriate model given the user’s research question, 
and then provide an output that was easily interpretable by someone largely unfamiliar with ML models.

This repo contains example outputs from some of the end-to-end flows that I built.
